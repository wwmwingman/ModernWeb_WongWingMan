<h5>CHP reviews local HIV/AIDS situation in 2015</h5>
<p>A total of 725 additional cases of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection were reported to the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) in 2015, compared with 651 in 2014.</p>
<p>Reviewing the HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) situation in Hong Kong at a press conference today (February 23), the Consultant (Special Preventive Programme) of the CHP, Dr Wong Ka-hing, said that sexual transmission remained the major mode of HIV transmission.</p>
<p>He stressed the importance of proper use of condoms in reducing the risk of contracting HIV.</p>
<p>&quot;HIV is the cause of AIDS and, without treatment, about half of the HIV-infected people will progress to AIDS within ten years,&quot; Dr Wong remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;Members of the public with a history of unsafe sex should take an HIV antibody test early. They can call the DH's AIDS Hotline (2780 2211) for a free, anonymous and confidential HIV antibody test,&quot; Dr Wong said.</p>
<p>Of the 725 newly reported cases, 434 acquired the infection via homosexual or bisexual contact, 135 through heterosexual contact, 14 through drug injection and two by perinatal transmission. The routes of transmission of the remaining 140 cases had yet to be determined due to inadequate information.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2015, 184 new cases of HIV infection were reported, taking the cumulative total of HIV infections reported locally to 7 718 since 1984.</p>
<p>Of the 184 cases, comprising 159 males and 25 females, 96 acquired the infection via homosexual or bisexual contact, 20 through heterosexual contact, three through drug injection and one by perinatal transmission. The routes of transmission of the remaining 64 cases had yet to be determined due to inadequate information.</p>
<p>The newly diagnosed cases of HIV infection in the same quarter were reported by three major sources: public hospitals and clinics (64 cases), private hospitals and clinics (34 cases) and the DH's Social Hygiene Clinics (33 cases).</p>
<p>Among the newly reported cases in the fourth quarter of last year, 104 cases (57 per cent) had received HIV specialist services at the DH or the Hospital Authority.</p>
<p>In addition, 29 new cases of AIDS were reported in the same quarter, bringing to 1 655 the total number of confirmed AIDS cases reported since 1985. Among the new cases, 16 cases (55 per cent) were attributed to homosexual or bisexual contact and nine cases (31 per cent) were related to heterosexual contact.</p>
<p>The most common AIDS-defining illness in this quarter was Pneumocystis pneumonia, a chest infection.</p>
<p>Members of the public can obtain a wide range of HIV/AIDS-related information from the DH's AIDS website (www.aids.gov.hk).</p>
