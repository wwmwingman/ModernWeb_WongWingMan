<h5>CHP reviews local HIV/AIDS situation in third quarter of 2015</h5>
<p>A total of 189 additional cases of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection were reported to the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) in the third quarter of 2015, bringing the cumulative total of reported HIV infections to 7 534 since 1984.</p>
<p>Reviewing the HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) situation in Hong Kong at a press conference today (November 24), the Consultant (Special Preventive Programme) of the CHP, Dr Wong Ka-hing, said that sexual transmission remained the major mode of HIV transmission.</p>
<p>Dr Wong stressed the importance of proper use of condoms in reducing the risk of contracting HIV.</p>
<p>"HIV is the cause of AIDS and, without treatment, about half of HIV-infected people will progress to AIDS within ten years," he remarked.</p>
<p>"Members of the public with a history of unsafe sex should take an HIV antibody test early. They can call the DH's AIDS Hotline (2780 2211) for a free, anonymous and confidential HIV test," Dr Wong said.</p>
<p>Of the 189 HIV cases reported in this quarter, 113 acquired the infection via homosexual or bisexual contact, 36 via heterosexual contact and three through drug injection. The routes of transmission of the remaining 37 cases have yet to be determined due to inadequate information.</p>
<p>The 189 cases comprise 167 males and 22 females.</p>
<p>The newly diagnosed cases of the third quarter of 2015 were mainly reported by three major sources: public hospitals and clinics (71 cases), AIDS service organisations (37 cases) and the DH's Social Hygiene Clinics (25 cases).</p>
<p>In addition, 19 new cases of AIDS were reported in this quarter, bringing to 1 626 the total number of confirmed AIDS cases reported since 1985. Among the new cases, 53 per cent were attributed to homosexual or bisexual contact and 42 per cent were related to heterosexual contact.</p>
<p>In this quarter, the most common AIDS-defining illness was <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia.</p>
<p>Of the newly reported cases in the third quarter this year, 130 of them (69 per cent) have already received HIV specialist services at the DH or the Hospital Authority.</p>
<p>Members of the public can obtain a wide range of HIV/AIDS-related information from the DH's AIDS website (www.aids.gov.hk).</p>
<p>Ends/Tuesday, November 24, 2015</p>
